This program first asks user for his/her name and age and say hi to the user. Then it asks for a grade and convert it into format of letter grade.

Hello everyone. Wellcome to cmpinf 0010
Hello everyone. I'm Hao Wang.

<h1>Python Practice</h1>
Python Practice is a collection of Python programs designed to help you improve your coding skills. It includes exercises and examples covering various topics, such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more.


<h2>What the Software Does</h2>
Python Practice is designed to help you improve your Python coding skills by providing a set of exercises and examples. Each exercise is designed to challenge you and improve your understanding of a specific concept or technique. Examples are provided to illustrate how to use Python to solve common problems and perform various tasks.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To install Python Practice, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `[git clone [repository URL]](https://github.com/XRdXu/CMPINF-0010-Labs/blob/main/README.md)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd python-practice`

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use Python Practice, follow these steps:

1. Choose an exercise or example from the exercises or examples directories.
2. Open the corresponding Python file in your favorite text editor or IDE.
3. Read the instructions or comments at the top of the file to understand the objective and requirements.
4. Write your solution to the exercise or modify the example code as needed.
5. Run the Python file to test your code and see the output.

<h2>Example Code</h2>
Here is an example of an exercise from Python Practice that challenges you to implement a simple calculator:

```python
# # Exercise: Simple Calculator

# Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then performs a simple calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on them.

# Ask the user for the first number.
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Ask the user for the second number.
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Ask the user for the operation to perform.
op = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the calculation based on the user's input.
if op == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif op == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif op == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif op == "/":
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    print("Invalid operation.")

# Display the result.
print("Result: ", result)

```

<h2>Miscellany</h2> 
Liense choose: (MIT license)The program we've written is just a demo code to practice the basics of Python, and there's nothing particularly interesting about the technology that needed to be protected by a protective license.  Therefore the license we chose for it was the Mit license.  According to its definition and the explanation of the Lab lecture, it is basically saying "do whatever you want to do, just don't sue me", which is very much in line with our needs, and that is why we choose it.
