Miscellany:  
Liense choose: (MIT license)The program we've written is just a demo code to practice the basics of Python, and there's nothing particularly interesting about the technology that needed to be protected by a protective license.  Therefore the license we chose for it was the Mit license.  According to its definition and the explanation of the Lab lecture, it is basically saying "do whatever you want to do, just don't sue me", which is very much in line with our needs, and that is why we choose it.
